DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=c2wapi
DB_USERNAME=c2wapi
DB_PASSWORD=c2wapi
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
``` 
2. Spin up containers
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build // build the project containers. Note: In Dev, run once or everytime the containers need to be respawned.
```
3. Install / Publish node modules and set `watch` to monitor code updates.
```bash
$ make npm-devup
```
4. Run the DB migrations & seed the database with test data
```bash
$ make fresh
```
5. If you experience any database related errors, then run the following db rollback command, and repeat step 4.
```bash
$ make rollback-test
```
6. Login with the test user credentials.
